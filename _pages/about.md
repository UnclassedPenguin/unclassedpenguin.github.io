Hey, I'm Tyler.

I am interested in technology of all sorts. Have a history working at a (mostly W)ISP and doing IT work, as well as splicing, and configuring the hardware for fiber optic internet.

I'd really like to advance my skills in programming and start contributing to open source projects.

Currently I'm learning Go, Ruby, JavaScript as well as working on my HTML and CSS.

Thanks for checking out my blog. I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/UnclassedPenguin).

Happy Coding :)
