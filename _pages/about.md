Hey, I'm Tyler. I am interested in technology of all sorts. Have a history working at an ISP and doing IT.

I'd really like to advance my skills in programming and start contributing to open source projects.

Currently I'm learning Ruby/JavaScript as well as working on my html/css.

Thanks for checking out my blog. I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/UnclassedPenguin).

Happy Coding :)
