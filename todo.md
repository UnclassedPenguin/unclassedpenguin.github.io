<h3 class="randomcolor">To-Do on Site</h3>  
 This is just for my personal tracking. 
 Might as well be public, eh?

-----
- [ ] Add Projects page
- [x] Implement sitemap
- [x] Implement syntax highlighting
  - Maybe not done...I'm not really happy with the coloring of the syntax. Keep thinking on it. 
- [ ] SEO
  - [ ] Research SEO plugin for Jekyll
  - [x] Implement jekyll-seo-tag Plugin
- [ ] Search
  - [ ] Research search (lawl) (lunr perhaps?)
  - [ ] Implement search
- [ ] Implement categories
  - [ ] Look into jekyll-archives
  - [x] Categories page
    - /categories is live. Not sure I need archives?
    - [x] Display categories on post's
- [x] Featured image perhaps?  
  - This is implemented in post. Maybe still add it to main page? 
- [x] Pagination
  - [x] Pages
  - [x] Next/Previous post links 
- [x] Keep working on getRandomColor.js to give links different colors instead of all the same. 
  - I'm going to call this fine for now. It might be too colorful, can always change it later...
- [x] Add <--more--> for continue reading 
  - Again. Not sure I'm happy with this. Leave it for now.  
  - (I added excerpt_separator to _config.yml. as well as edited blog.html to add button beneath excerpt) 
- [x] Style blockquotes  
  - All I did was italic and padding left/right
- [ ] Test :)
  - Thing 2
