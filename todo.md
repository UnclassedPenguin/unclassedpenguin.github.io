<h2 class="randomcolor">To-Do on Site</h2>  
 This is just for my personal tracking. 
 Might as well be public, eh?

-----

- [x] Implement sitemap
- [x] Implement syntax highlighting
	- Maybe not done...I'm not really happy with the coloring of the syntax. Keep thinking on it. 
- [ ] SEO
	- [ ] Research SEO plugin for Jekyll
	- [x] Implement jekyll-seo-tag Plugin
- [ ] Search
	- [ ] Research search (lawl) (lunr perhaps?)
	- [ ] Implement search
- [ ] Implement categories
	- [ ] Look into jekyll-archives
	- [x] Categories page
		- /categories is live. Not sure I need archives?
	- [x] Display categories on post's
- [ ] Featured image perhaps?
- [ ] Pagination
	- [ ] Pages
	- [x] Next/Previous post links 
- [x] Keep working on getRandomColor.js to give links different colors instead of all the same. 
	- I'm going to call this fine for now. It might be too colorful, can always change it later...
- [x] Add <--more--> for continue reading
        - Again. Not sure I'm happy with this. Leave it for now. 
         (I added excerpt_separator to _config.yml. as well as edited blog.html to add button beneath excerpt)
- [ ] Test :)
