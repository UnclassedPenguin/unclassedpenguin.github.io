 This is just for my personal tracking. 
 Might as well be public, eh?

-----
- [x] Add Projects page
  - Added project page and project.yaml to add new ones. pretty easy. 
- [x] Implement sitemap
- [x] Implement syntax highlighting
  - Maybe not done...I'm not really happy with the coloring of the syntax. Keep thinking on it. 
- [ ] SEO
  - [ ] Research SEO plugin for Jekyll
  - [x] Implement jekyll-seo-tag Plugin
- [x] Search
  - [x] Research search (lawl) (lunr perhaps?)
  - [x] Implement search
    - I ended up going with [Simple-Jekyll-Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_--> following [this tutorial](https://blog.webjeda.com/instant-jekyll-search/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- [x] Implement categories
  - [ ] Look into jekyll-archives
  - [x] Categories page
    - /categories is live. Not sure I need archives?
    - [x] Display categories on post's
- [x] Featured image perhaps?  
  - This is implemented in post. Maybe still add it to main page? 
- [x] Pagination
  - [x] Pages
  - [x] Next/Previous post links 
- [x] Keep working on getRandomColor.js to give links different colors instead of all the same. 
  - I'm going to call this fine for now. It might be too colorful, can always change it later...
- [x] Add <--more--> for continue reading 
  - Again. Not sure I'm happy with this. Leave it for now.  
  - (I added excerpt_separator to _config.yml. as well as edited blog.html to add button beneath excerpt) 
- [x] Style blockquotes  
  - All I did was italic and padding left/right
- [x] Test :)
