First things first, what is Vim?  
Well, lets ask [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->: 
>Vim (a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is released under the Vim license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The Vim license is compatible with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies under the GNU GPL version 2.0 or later.  


*Working Here*



My [first article](https://unclassed.ca/2018/spacemacs-as-a-main-text-editor/){:class="randomcolor"} on my blog is a post about using [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_--> as my main text editor. That article was written around 3 years ago and since then, to be honest, I have barely used Spacemacs at all. I don't even currently have it installed on any of my computers. What I do have on all of my computers however is [vim](https://www.vim.org/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->. When I say all of my computers, that includes laptops, desktops, and even all of my servers.

> Sidenote: I run several servers for various reasons. I have a home server for "cloud" storage(Running [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->. Really it's just a backup server to have a seperate place to store important things in a central location. Not accessible to the broader internet, it's local only, but that is fine for me. I also run a minecraft server for multiplayer games with my brother, as well as a webserver/general purpose server that is a [VPS](https://m.do.co/c/d028c143320b){:target="_blank" class="randomcolor"}<!--_--> from Digital Ocean, so it **is** available to the broader internet. I have used it for all sorts of things from a basic webserver, a private Git repository, to a [self hosted chat](https://www.mumble.info/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_--> server. 

The fact that I can run it on everything from laptops to servers is one of the main reasons I love vim. I store my [dotfiles](https://github.com/unclassedpenguin/dotfiles.git){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_--> on GitHub, so I can even keep all of my configurations easily synced between machines which lets me use all of my custom keyboard shortcuts no matter where I am.
