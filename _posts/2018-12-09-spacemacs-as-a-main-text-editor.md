I had been avoiding <a class="randomcolor" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> for quite awhile because I was a little iffy about all the complicated keyboard shortcuts, but I decided to finally bite the bullet and downloaded it on my Ubuntu 18.04 laptop.

I spent some time using the default emacs, and decided I wanted to find something a bit easier. After searching around I found <a class="randomcolor" href="https://www.spacemacs.org/" target="_blank">Spacemacs</a>, which everything I read said that it was a great alternative if you wanted the power of emacs without the hassle of writing all of your own configuration files. 

It has turned out to be a great decision. I have been using it for all of my programming for the last two weeks and I love it. I highly recommend you trying it out if you are looking for a clean text editor that can help you in programming.
