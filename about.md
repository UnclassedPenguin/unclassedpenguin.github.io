        <p>  Hey, I’m Tyler. </p>
        <p> I am interested in technology of all sorts. Have a history working at a (mostly W)ISP and doing IT work, as well as splicing, and configuring the hardware for fiber optic internet.  </p>
        <p> I’d really like to advance my skills in programming and start contributing to open source projects.  </p>
        <p> Currently I’m learning Go, Ruby, JavaScript as well as working on my HTML and CSS.  </p>
        <p>  Thanks for checking out my blog. I also have a <a href="https://githib.com/unclassedpenguin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. </p>
        <p> Happy Coding :)  </p>
