<h3 class="randomcolor pb-3 text-center">About Me</h3>

Hey, I’m Tyler.  

I am interested in technology of all sorts. Have a history working at a (mostly W)ISP and doing IT work, as well as splicing, and configuring the hardware for fiber optic internet.  

I’d really like to advance my skills in programming and start contributing to open source projects.  

Currently I’m learning Go, Ruby, JavaScript as well as working on my HTML and CSS.  

Thanks for checking out my blog. I also have a <a class="randomcolor" href="https://github.com/unclassedpenguin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  

You can contact me [here](https://github.com/UnclassedPenguin/UnclassedPenguin/discussions/1){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->, using GitHub Discussions. Or, my name @ this domain.  

Happy Coding :)  


<h3 class="randomcolor pb-3 text-center">About This Site</h3>

This site is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_--> and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->. It's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->([source](https://github.com/UnclassedPenguin/unclassedpenguin.github.io){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->) using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->.  

I'm quite happy with this build for a blog. I got tired of self-hosting a blog with Wordpress and dealing with the constant bot attacks. Wordpress is a bit overkill I think if all you want is a static blog.


<h3 class="randomcolor pb-3 text-center">My Setup</h3>

I run linux on all of my computers. ~~Mainly [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->. I have tried all sorts of different distros and always end up back at Ubuntu. Currently on my main laptop I use Ubuntu 20.04.~~ I now use Linux Mint as my main distro, with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->, and all of my editing/coding is done with [vim](https://vim.org){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->. You can checkout [my dotfiles](https://github.com/unclassedpenguin/dotfiles){:class="randomcolor" target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
